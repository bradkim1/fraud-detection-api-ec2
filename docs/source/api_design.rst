API Design Principles
====================

Fraud Detection API follows these core REST API design principles:

Resource-Oriented Design
-----------------------

* API is organized around resources (transactions, metrics, etc.)
* Uses standard HTTP methods appropriately:
  * GET for retrieving data
  * POST for creating resources and performing actions

Consistency
----------

* All endpoints return JSON with consistent structure
* Error responses follow a standard format
* Field naming conventions are consistent throughout

Proper Error Handling
-------------------

* Appropriate HTTP status codes for different error conditions
* Descriptive error messages to help clients understand issues
* Validation of input data before processing

Versioning
---------

* API version included in the URL path
* Backward compatibility maintained when possible

Security
-------

* Input validation to prevent injection attacks
* Rate limiting to prevent abuse
* Authentication for production use (commented out in development)

Performance
----------

* Efficient processing of requests
* Caching when appropriate
* Pagination for large result sets

Documentation
------------

* OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
* Examples for all endpoints
* Clear descriptions of parameters and responses
